Debugging
• Mostly through gdb (you can find many online 
resources)
• valgrind is a quite helpful tool as well

Profiling
• Let’s say I have a piece of code with many 
functions
• How to know where most of the time is spent and, 
thus, where it would make most sense to optimize? 
(Remember: “Premature optimization is the root of 
all evil”)
• We could explicitly time each function (boring, 
time consuming)
• We can use a profiler that does that for us (see 
https://hpc-wiki.info/hpc/Gprof_Tutorial)
